# The encrypt method takes a message String as an argument. It can optionally take a
# Key and Date as arguments to use for encryption. If the key is not included, generate
#  a random key. If the date is not included, use todayâ€™s date.

Consider the date formatted as a number, DDMMYY. If the date is August 4, 1995, it would be represented as 040895.
Square the numeric form (1672401025)
Take the last four digits (1025)
A offset: The first digit (1)
B offset: The second digit (0)
C offset: The third digit (2)
D offset: The fourth digit (5)
